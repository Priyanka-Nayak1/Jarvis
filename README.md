#Overview
This project implements a custom Jarvis Skill using Python. The skill interacts with users through voice commands, providing responses based on the intent of the user's queries. The project leverages AWS Lambda to handle requests and responses between Jarvis and the backend logic.

#Features
Custom Intents: Handles various intents defined for the skill, including providing information, answering questions, and more.
AWS Lambda Integration: The skill logic is deployed on AWS Lambda, ensuring a scalable and serverless architecture.
Voice Interaction: Allows users to interact with the skill using natural language through Jarvis-enabled devices.
Error Handling: Built-in mechanisms to handle unexpected user inputs and errors gracefully.

#Getting Started
